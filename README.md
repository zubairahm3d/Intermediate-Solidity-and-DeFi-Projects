# Advanced Smart Contract Projects

A comprehensive collection of smart contract projects to master Solidity and Ethereum development. These projects cover core architecture, data structures, tokenization, security, DeFi, governance, and testing, enabling you to build secure, efficient, and complex decentralized applications (dApps).

---

## Prerequisites
- Solid understanding of blockchain, Ethereum, and Solidity basics.
- Familiarity with programming (JavaScript/TypeScript recommended).
- Tools: [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), Foundry for development and testing.
- Solidity version: `^0.8.0` (unless specified otherwise for compatibility).

## Tokenization and Wallets (1–15)

### 1. Create a Simple ERC20 Token (from Scratch)
- **Description**: Implement an ERC20 token with balance tracking, transfers.
- **Key Concepts**: ERC20 standard, tokenomics.

### 2. Implement a Token with Transfer Restrictions
- **Description**: Add restrictions (e.g., whitelist, time locks) to an ERC20 token’s transfers.
- **Key Concepts**: Transfer restrictions, access control.

### 3. Create a Mintable and Burnable Token
- **Description**: Extend an ERC20 token with minting and burning functions.
- **Key Concepts**: Minting, burning, supply management.

### 4. Implement a Token with Approval Mechanism
- **Description**: Allow users to approve spenders for their ERC20 tokens.
- **Key Concepts**: ERC20 approvals, delegated transfers.

### 5. Create a Simple Vesting Schedule for Tokens
- **Description**: Implement a vesting contract to release tokens over time.
- **Key Concepts**: Vesting schedules, time-based releases.
