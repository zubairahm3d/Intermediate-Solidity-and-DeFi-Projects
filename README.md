# Advanced Smart Contract Projects (1-100)

A comprehensive collection of smart contract projects to master Solidity and Ethereum development. These projects cover core architecture, data structures, tokenization, security, DeFi, governance, and testing, enabling you to build secure, efficient, and complex decentralized applications (dApps).

## Prerequisites
- Solid understanding of blockchain, Ethereum, and Solidity basics.
- Familiarity with programming (JavaScript/TypeScript recommended).
- Tools: [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), Hardhat, or Truffle for development and testing.
- Solidity version: `^0.8.0` (unless specified otherwise for compatibility).

## Basic Smart Contract Architecture (1â€“15)

### 1. Create a Contract with Multiple Constructors Using Inheritance
- **Description**: Build a base and derived contract with distinct constructors to initialize state variables differently.
- **Key Concepts**: Inheritance, constructor chaining, `super` keyword.
